Hej Stefano Otto,<br />
this is about lab 2 of DA2004.<br />
<br />
You have done a good job and <strong>passed the lab</strong>! What follows are some tips for future improvement and/or positive comments. Please do take some time to go through them: I would expect you to incorporate this advice in future labs, when facing similar scenarios :) <br />
<br />
You may, of course, get back for further clarification if needed. Notice that you do not have to revise anything - but do go through the list and make sure all of it is clear! <br />
<br />

- line breaks are free, use them! It makes the code so much easier to read! At least to separate different functions, a blank line!<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work!<br />
A nice day,<br />

Hej Viktor Johansson,<br />
this is about lab 2 of DA2004.<br />
<br />
You have done a <strong>good job so far, but there are some things that really have to be reviewed before the lab can be considered as passed</strong>. Below you find the tasks that require review and tips on how to do so. <strong>Tasks marked with a star * are required</strong> to be reviewed, the others are NOT required (but you may of course tackle them as well). <br />
<br />
After you have fixed the issues, <strong>you will have to show and present the new code to me during a lab session</strong> (and may also ask for further help there, if needed).<br />
<br />
You may also find other tips for future improvement and/or positive comments. Please do take some time to go through them: I would expect you to incorporate this advice in future labs, when facing similar scenarios :) You may, of course, get back for further clarification if needed. <br />
<br />
- * if a string is given in the guessing game, a message is displayed but the software does also go on to check whether the number is smaller or bigger than the target:<br />
<pre>Guess a number! q<br />
You must guess a number!<br />
Too low</pre><br />
- your function <code>create_all_pairs_rec</code> does not use <code>map</code>, as per specifications. Also, the case <code>if len(xs) == 0 or len(ys) == 0:</code> is useless<br />
- to count words, <code>len(line.split())</code> is enough, no need to have <code>is_word()</code><br />
<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work!<br />
A nice day,<br />
