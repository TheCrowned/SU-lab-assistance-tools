Hej {to-name},
this is about lab {lab-n} of {course-name}.

You have done a <strong>good job so far, but there are some things that really have to be reviewed before the lab can be considered as passed</strong>. Below you find the tasks that require review and tips on how to do so. <strong>Tasks marked with a star * are required</strong> to be reviewed, while the others are NOT required (but you may of course tackle them as well). 

After you have fixed the issues, <strong>you have to <em>(in this order)</em>:
1. show and present the new code to me during a lab session</strong> (and may also ask for further help there, if needed);
<strong>2. send the updated code to me by email.</strong>

You may also find other tips for future improvement and/or positive comments. Please do take some time to go through them: I would expect you to incorporate this advice in future labs, when facing similar scenarios :) You may, of course, get back for further clarification if needed.

Keep up the good work!
A nice day,
{from-name}
