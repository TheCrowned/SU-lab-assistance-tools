Hej {to-name},
this is about lab {lab-n} of {course-name}.

You have done a good job so far, but <strong>there are some things that, albeit minor issues, really need to be reviewed before the lab can be considered as passed</strong>. Below you find the tasks that require review and tips on how to do so. <strong>Tasks marked with a star * are required</strong> to be reviewed, the others are NOT required (but you may of course tackle them as well). 

<strong>You may email back the corrected code to me, you do not need to present it during a lab session</strong> (but you may always ask for help there if needed).

You may also find other tips for future improvement and/or positive comments. Please do take some time to go through them: I would expect you to incorporate this advice in future labs, when facing similar scenarios :) You may, of course, get back for further clarification if needed.

Keep up the good work!
A nice day,
