A collection of tools developed to aid the work of teachers and Teaching Assistants at the Mathematics Department of Stockholm University. Further details and documentation on usage can be found inside the individual packages.

- `send-mail-results`: sends out emails to students with feedback on their labs, given a feedback file.
- `generate-grading-template`: generates a grading template that can be used as feedback file to use with `send-mail-results`. Also handles TAs grading rotation (decentralized and deterministic).
